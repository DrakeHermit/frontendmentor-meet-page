## My process

I started working on the mobile version of the design and gradually moved onto tablet and desktop designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot honestly, hidding and showing of content based on the device size, working with breakpoints closer even if it isn't perfect. I also learned that making a website responsive for all three device sizes is quite the arduous task.

### Continued development

I need to work on structuring my CSS and HTML better. HTML wise I need to work on making my website more accessible since that is something I struggle with.
